Once there was a thristy crow, who was searching for water. 
After searching for a long time he finally found a pot full of water.
But the water was too shallow and the crow could not drink it.
The crow found some pebbles nearby and dropped those one by one in the pot of water.
The water reached the height of the crow.
The crow then happily drank the water and flew away.
